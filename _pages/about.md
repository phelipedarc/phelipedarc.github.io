Hey! I'm Phelipe Darc, mostly known as Phe, a physicist working with Machine Learning (ML) applied to Astrophysics/Astronomy. I am a Ph.D student at the [Centro Brasileiro De Pesquisas F√≠sicas (CBPF)](https://www.gov.br/cbpf/pt-br/o-cbpf/biografia) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I have interests in multi-messenger astronomy and astrophysics (especially, Binary Neutron Star mergers, Kilonova ejecta models, BBH models), machine learning, data science and programming. 

Research üåå
======

I have applied Deep learning techineques to astrophysics/atronomy, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoders, and Simulation-Based inference (SBI). 
A highlight was my master‚Äôs thesis, where I developed two Convolutional Neural Networks. One focused on artifact removal and transient identification in difference imaging, integrated into the [S-PLUS](https://www.splus.iag.usp.br/) Transient Extension Program ([STEP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15057)). The other was developed to detect electromagnetic counterparts to GW events, which was incorporated into the [DESGW search and discovery pipeline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133720300792) led by Marcele Soares Santos. 

During my internship at the Laborat√≥rio Nacional de Computa√ß√£o Cient√≠fica ([LNCC](https://www.gov.br/lncc/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/institucional/o-lncc-1)), I developed an algorithm utilizing BERTimbau, a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. This algorithm classifyies phrases describing medical conditions in Portuguese. Additionally, I created a custom script leveraging Google APIs and the Regex library to efficiently gather and process/filter data from YouTube comments

Presently, my Ph.D research is focused on employing Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) techniques to infer the physical parameters of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) kilonovae from their spectra. This groundbreaking work is currently under review for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, following the acceptance and presentation of its extended abstract at the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2023. My research aims to develop robust tools enabling the extraction of meaningful astrophysical insights from spectral data in a fast, scalable, and testable way, utilizing the power of Neural Networks.
