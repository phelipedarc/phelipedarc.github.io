Hey! I'm Phelipe Darc, mostly known as Phe, a physicist working with Machine Learning (ML) applied to Astrophysics/Astronomy. I am a Ph.D student at the [Centro Brasileiro De Pesquisas F√≠sicas (CBPF)](https://www.gov.br/cbpf/pt-br/o-cbpf/biografia) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the supervision of [Clecio R. De Bom](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Clecio-Bom). I'm deeply passionate about multi-messenger astronomy and astrophysics, with particular interests in phenomena like Binary Neutron Star mergers, Kilonova ejecta models, and BBH models. Alongside, I have a strong affinity for machine learning, data science, and programming.


Research üåå
======

In my journey, I've extensively applied Deep Learning techniques to astrophysics and astronomy, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoders, and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI).
A notable highlight is my master‚Äôs thesis, where I developed two CNNs classifiers. One focused on artifact removal and transient identification in difference imaging, integrated into the [S-PLUS](https://www.splus.iag.usp.br/) Transient Extension Program ([STEP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15057)). The other was developed to detect electromagnetic counterparts to GW events, which was incorporated into the [DESGW search and discovery pipeline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133720300792) led by Marcele Soares Santos. 

During my internship at the Laborat√≥rio Nacional de Computa√ß√£o Cient√≠fica ([LNCC](https://www.gov.br/lncc/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/institucional/o-lncc-1)), I developed an algorithm utilizing BERTimbau, a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. This algorithm classifyies phrases describing medical conditions in Portuguese. Additionally, I created a custom script leveraging Google APIs and the Regex library to efficiently gather and process/filter data from YouTube comments.

Currently, my Ph.D. research is centered around employing Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) techniques to infer the physical parameters of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) kilonovae from their spectra. This work is currently under review for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, following the acceptance and presentation of its extended abstract at the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2023. My research goal is to develop robust tools enabling the extraction of meaningful astrophysical insights from spectral/light curve data in a fast, scalable, and testable way, leveraging the power of Neural Networks.
