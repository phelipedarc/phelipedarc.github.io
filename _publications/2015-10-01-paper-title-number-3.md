excerpt: 'We present the S-PLUS Transient Extension Program (STEP): a supernova and fast transient survey conducted in the southern hemisphere using data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Main Survey and the T80-South telescope. Transient astrophysical phenomena have a range of interest that goes through different fields of astrophysics and cosmology. With the detection of an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 from a binary neutron stars merger, new techniques and resources to study fast astrophysical transients in the multi-messenger context have increased. In this paper, we present the STEP overview, the SN follow-up data obtained, data reduction, analysis of new transients and deep learning algorithms to optimize transient candidate selection. Additionally, we present prospects and optimized strategy for the search of Gravitational Wave counterparts in the current LIGO/Virgo/Kagra observational run (O4) in the context of T80-South telescope.'
